For Points, you also have not really pulled things apart into independence as there is both Completing and Point Awarding aspects to this concept. You have this verification aspect, but that wasn't mentioned as a concept before so how are we ensuring that things are verified? Additionally, it seems a bit redundant to have award__points, why can you have one general awardPoints function and pass in the number of points as a parameter? On that note, what is the difference between awardFivePoints and awardOnePoint, why does one require a verifier and the other does not? You need to pull these apart more to make that difference clear. Could this functiaonlity be better implemented as a sync? If you think about the difference in functionality, it's probably a change that is deeper than just a difference in point allocationâ€“could this be a different concept? These sorts of questions should be explained in the concept definition.
